/*
Certainly! The `defer` statement in Go is used to schedule a function call to be executed later, typically when the surrounding function returns. It allows you to postpone the execution of a function until the surrounding function has completed, regardless of whether it returns normally or with an error.

The `defer` statement is often used to ensure that certain cleanup or finalization tasks are performed, such as closing files or releasing resources, regardless of the execution path taken in a function.

The only change in this program is the last line in which we return file.Close(). If the call to Close results in an error, this will now be returned as expected to the calling function. Keep in mind that our defer file.Close() statement is also going to run after the return statement. This means that file.Close() is potentially called twice. While this isnâ€™t ideal, it is an acceptable practice as it should not create any side effects to your program.
